# Bike Sharing

This analysis explores the trends and factors influencing bike-sharing rentals from 2011 to 2012. The dataset consists of 731 observations with 14 variables, including weather conditions, dates, and rental counts.

Key insights are drawn from visualizations and statistical summaries:

• Trend Analysis: 

A clear seasonal pattern is observed, with higher rentals in warmer months, particularly during summer and fall. Winter sees a decline in usage. Rentals increase notably from 2011 to 2012, suggesting growing popularity.

• Monthly Analysis: 

Boxplots and ridge plots reveal the variability of rentals across months, showing that summer months have higher median rentals compared to colder months. Density plots provide a finer detail of monthly distribution.

• Day and Weather Impacts: 

Rentals are lower on holidays and higher on working days, with better weather conditions (clear skies) leading to increased rentals. Adverse weather such as precipitation reduces bike usage significantly.

• Outliers: 

Boxplot analysis of temperature, humidity, and wind speed identifies and removes outliers to ensure the analysis focuses on typical conditions rather than extreme weather events.

Overall, the analysis emphasizes the influence of seasonality, weather, and day type on bike-sharing patterns, aiding in understanding user behavior and improving service management.
